## Documentation
See the [Power BI embedded analytics Client APIs documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/overview/powerbi/) to learn how to embed a Power BI report in your application and how to use the client APIs.

## Reference
See the [library reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/powerbi/powerbi-client/) for detailed information about classes, interfaces, types, etc.

## Playground
The [playground](https://aka.ms/pbieplayground) is the home for Power BI embedded analytics, where you can get hands-on coding experience, embed your own reports, and interact with our client APIs to see instant results. In addition, you’ll find there our interactive showcases to get inspiration regarding how you can apply these features in your applications. Lastly, we’ve created a new learning center to help you find all the relevant samples, tutorials, and documentation you’ll need for a successful integration.

## Installation

Install via Nuget:

`Install-Package Microsoft.PowerBI.JavaScript`

Install from NPM:

`npm install --save powerbi-client`

Installing beta versions:

`npm install --save powerbi-client@beta`

## Include the library via import or manually

Ideally you would use a module loader or a compilation step to import using ES6 modules as:

```javascript
import * as pbi from 'powerbi-client';
```

However, the library is exported as a Universal Module and the powerbi.js script can be included before your app's closing `</body>` tag as:

```html
<script src="/powerbi-client/dist/powerbi.js"></script>
```

When included directly, the library is exposed as a global named `powerbi-client`.
There is also another global named `powerbi` which is an instance of the service.
